    "This is a project to make a dataset of California public high schools, along with modelling their scores on the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP). The purpose is to build a dataset that could be used for other projects and to use AI to model the educational disparities in different types of California public schools. California was selected because of the large amount of data it publishes on its schools. The dataset was constructed with publically available data from the <a href=\"https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/ad/accessdatasub.asp\">California Department of Education website</a>. The dataset contains information on basic identification (school name and CSD number), physical location (both coordinates and district/county/city), type of school (charter/magnet/virtual or none), percentage of students receiving free or reduced-price meals (FRPM), demographic data including gender and race makeup of the school, as well as scores on the CAASPP for school years 2015-16 to 2021-22. There is no test data for school year 2020-21 because tests were not conducted then, but other data is available for that year. An example of a full row of data in the dataset is shown below (the fifth row is shown because this is the first row with no columns missing)."

    "In regards to the model, training it on my Surface laptop CPU typically takes about 1 minute and 40 seconds, and I typically reach a loss of roughly 0.035, with a similar validation loss. I used a learning rate of 0.01 because this learning rate produced the lowest loss out of the three I tried (0.1, 0.01, and 0.001), and I capped training at 3 epochs because the model did not improve much beyond 0.035 when I ran it for more than 3. An example model call is shown below. The model will predict the proportion from 0 to 1 of students that met the standard set by the state or exceeded them (Met and Above% in the dataset, divided by 100)."
