    "<h1> City Health </h1>\n",
    "This was a small project to get used to doing three things that I was not as familiar with in data science but I would like to get more familiar with, namely, working with more numerical data, using the Julia programming language, and interacting with <a href=\"data.gov\">government data</a>. I got data from the Department of Health and Human services, specifically data about various health afflictions from various US cities. I did a simple statistical analysis of the data, finding multiple single-variable data points for the afflictions, like the mean, standard deviation, and variance, and then I compared the data to find the afflictions that had the highest positive and negative correlations with each other. The basic single-variable information (as well as some information about correlations) can be found in basicinfo.csv, while the exact correlations can be found in correlations.csv."
